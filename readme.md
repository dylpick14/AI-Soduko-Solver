AI Soduko Solver

This project was a part of my Artificial Intelligence Class. 
All functions with the TODO comment were functions that I did.
There are a few functions that are still broke on the project.
Those functions are:
  1. Minimum Remaining Values
  2. Maximum Remaining Values
  3. Arc Consistency

All other functions should be functioning correctly.

The purpose of this project was to use Artificial Intelligence in order to solve any soduko test. For this program there are 3 test cases in which the program will be able to solve any of the 3. The program will return the solved soduko board, how long it took to solve, and how many nodes were cycled through.
